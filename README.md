### What makes it challenging?
- The platform's rotation continuously accelerates, making the game both challenging and fun.
- After 10 seconds, the platform begins to shrink, forcing players into intense close-quarters combat.
- A hypnotic spiral pattern on the platform creates a dizzying visual effect as it spins, adding to the challenge and immersion.
